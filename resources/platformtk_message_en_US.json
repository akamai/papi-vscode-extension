An average web page requires multiple items, such as javaScript, CSS, and images. References to these items are in the HTML pages the server produces. Server Push allows the server to send the most important items immediately. <br /><br />* Automatic Preconnect through link HTTP headers: Allows browsers to anticipate what connections the site needs and establishes those connections ahead of time, but it does not load or request anything. <br /><br />The Adaptive Acceleration behavior requires that you enable both HTTP/2 and RUM on the same property."
